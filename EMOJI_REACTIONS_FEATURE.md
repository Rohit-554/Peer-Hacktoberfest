4. Receive and see reactions from other participants

### For Developers
```javascript
// Send a reaction
dataChannelManager.broadcast({
  type: 'reaction',
  emoji: '👍',
  peerId: 'sender-id',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Listen for reactions
dataChannelManager.onMessage = (data) => {
  if (data.type === 'reaction') {
    // Handle reaction
  }
};
```

## Browser Compatibility
